#  Example idshosts file.
#
#  idshosts is a text file that resembles the standard Windows LMHOSTS 
#  specifications.  
# 
#  For Windows, the idshosts file is searched for in the following
#  directories:
#          - the directory from which the application loaded
#          - the current directory
#          - the <windows>\SYSTEM32 directory
#          - the <windows>\SYSTEM directory
#          - the <windows> directory
#          - the directories in the PATH
#
#  For Linux, idshosts must reside in $ACTIANZEN_ROOT/etc
#  i.e. /usr/local/actianzen/etc
#
#  idshosts is formatted as follows:
#
#  1. All comments must be preceded by #
#  2. The UNC or drive (for Windows clients) string being mapped has to
#     be the first entry on a new line.
#  3  For Windows clients, UNC mappings start with two back slashes.
#     For Linux clients, UNC mappings start with two forward slashes.
#  4. One or more spaces must separate the drive or UNC string being 
#     mapped from the server name.
#  5. If the path contains spaces it must be enclosed in double quotes.
#  6. An optional Database name may be specified after the 
#     server name, separated by one or more spaces.
#
# The PSQL client requester constructs a Btrieve URI using the
# information from the matching idshosts entry.
# For example, if the application passes in the following:
#     l:\accounting\dir1\vendor.mkd
# the requester uses the last sample entry to create the following URI:
#     btrv://AcctServer/AcctDB?dbfile=dir1%5Cvendor.mkd
#
# j:                   www.example.com       # Drive mapping
# k:\myData\           10.1.1.1                # IP notation can be used
# \\dataServer\public  www.example.com       # Windows UNC mapping
# //dataServer/public  yourserver              # Linux UNC mapping
# "m:\my data\"        www.yourserver.com      # If there are spaces in 
#                                              # path the whole path must
#                                              # be enclosed by ""
# l:\accounting        AcctServer     AcctDB   # Example with Database name
